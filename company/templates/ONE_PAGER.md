# OITH - One In The Hand
## Executive Summary

---

### Company Overview

**OITH** is a premium dating application built on a revolutionary principle: *one match at a time*. By eliminating endless swiping and requiring all users to pay, we create focused, meaningful connections that actually lead to real dates.

---

### The Problem

Dating apps have created a paradox of choice. Users swipe for hours yet fewer than 12% of matches become dates. Women are overwhelmed with options while men mass-swipe desperately. Free tiers attract non-serious users, creating a race to the bottom.

**The result:** Frustrated users, low engagement, and a lot of lonely people.
